# Cleaner Agent

Cleaner Agent is a GitHub App focused on repository hygiene, organization, and operational guidance.

It works non-intrusively by observing GitHub activity such as pull requests and issues, providing automated feedback and suggestions without blocking workflows or enforcing policies.

Created by the same maintainers behind [Memory Forensics Library](https://github.com/MemoryForensicsLibrary).
